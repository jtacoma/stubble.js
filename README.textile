h1. stubble.js

*stubble.js* was conceived in need for a way to late-bind localized strings to properties of an object, prior to pretty-printing with "mustache.js":https://github.com/janl/mustache.js.  It may be useful for other purposes.

h2. Usage

@stubble()@ will copy property-value pairs from a @source@ to a @target@ with some mapping and localization.  In the code below, we setup a source and a target, then copy a localized property-value pair into the target:

bc. var localizedStrings = {
  dayOfWeek_name_en: 'Sunday Monday Tuesday etc.'.split(),
};
var datum = { dayOfWeek: 1 };
datum.stubble({source:localizedStrings, culture:'en'});

After this, @datum.dayOfWeek_name == 'Monday'@.

h2. Building

On *nix:

bc. cat src/* > stubble.js

or at a DOS prompt:

bc. type src\* > stubble.js

h2. Developing

@stubble.js@ is under @src@.  Jasmine specifications are under @spec@.

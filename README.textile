h1. stubble.js

*stubble.js* was conceived in need for a way to late-bind localized strings to properties of an object, prior to pretty-printing with "mustache.js":https://github.com/janl/mustache.js.  It may be useful for other purposes.

h2. Building

On *nix:

bc. cat src/* > stubble.js

or at a DOS prompt:

bc. type src\* > stubble.js

h2. Developing

@stubble.js@ is under @src@.  Jasmine specifications are under @spec@.

Collaborators welcome.  Feel free to fork the github project and send pull requests.
